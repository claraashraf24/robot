# Challenges
Drawing the whole body that was the easy part we had. Most challenging ones were controlling the body and camera movements.

While doing this task one of the hardest implementations was positioning the camera movements correctly horizontally and vertically as at the begining it was working on the upper part only of our model.

Adding to that writing the correct function to control animation of the arms using glutTimerFunc and limiting the arms' movement to a certain angle so they do not overlap on each other.
